# getUserTrophyProfileSummary

```ts
/**
 * A call to this function will retrieve an overall summary of the number of
 * trophies earned for a user broken down by type, as well as their current
 * overall trophy level, progress towards the next level and which tier their
 * current level falls in to. The tiers are based on the [level changes introduced in 2020](https://andshrew.github.io/PlayStation-Trophies/images/psn-trophy-tiers.png).
 *
 * The numeric `accountId` can be that of any PSN account for which the
 * authenticating account has permissions to view the trophy list.
 * When querying the titles associated with the authenticating account, the
 * numeric `accountId` can be substituted with `"me"`.
 *
 * To find a user's `accountId`, the `makeUniversalSearch()` function can be used.
 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your access token, typically retrieved with `exchangeCodeForAccessToken()`.
 * @param accountId The account whose trophy list is being accessed. Use `"me"` for the authenticating account.
 * @param options.headerOverrides Override the headers in the request to the PSN API, such as to change the language.
