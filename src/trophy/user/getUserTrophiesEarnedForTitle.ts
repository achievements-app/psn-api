/**
 * A call to this function will retrieve the earned status of trophies for a user
 * from either a single - or all - trophy groups in a title. A title can have
 * multiple groups of trophies (a `"default"` group which all titles have, and
 * additional groups starting with a name of `"001"` and incrementing for each
 * additional group). To retrieve trophies from all groups within a title
 * (ie. the full trophy set), then `trophyGroupId` should be set to `"all"`.
 *
 * The numeric `accountId` can be that of any PSN account for which the
 * authenticating account has permissions to view the trophy list.
 * When querying the titles associated with the authenticating account, the
 * numeric `accountId` can be substituted with `"me"`.
 *
 * This function returns the earned status of the
 * trophy only and no additional descriptive metadata (ie. trophy name,
 * trophy description). Use `getTitleTrophies()` to obtain this information.
 *
 * When the title platform is PS3, PS4, or PS Vita, you __must__ specify the
 * `npServiceName` option as `"trophy"`.
 *
 * If you attempt to query a title which the user does not have associated
 * with their account (ie. the title has not been launched and allowed to
 * sync at least once) then a Resource Not Found error will be thrown.
 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your access token, typically retrieved with `exchangeCodeForAccessToken()`.
 * @param accountId The account whose trophy list is being accessed. Use `"me"` for the authenticating account.
 * @param npCommunicationId Unique ID of the title.
 * @param trophyGroupId `"all"` to return all trophies for the title, otherwise restrict results to a specific trophy group (such as a DLC).
 * @param options.npServiceName `"trophy"` for PS3, PS4, or PS Vita platforms. `"trophy2"` for the PS5 platform.
 * @param options.limit Limit the number of trophies returned.
 * @param options.offset Return trophy data from this result onwards.
 * @param options.headerOverrides Override the headers in the request to the PSN API, such as to change the language.
