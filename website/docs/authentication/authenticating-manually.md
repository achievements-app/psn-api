# Authenticating Manually

The most common auth flow that users interacting with PSN's APIs use is the manual authentication flow. This flow is also described in the [Quick Start guide](/#quick-start).

The disadvantage to this flow is that after two months you will need to remember to manually retrieve another NPSSO token to ultimately exchange for access and refresh tokens.

## The authorization flow

From a high-level, to become authorized to use PSN's APIs, you must take the following steps:

1. Manually sign in on the PlayStation website with your email/password credentials (to retrieve some auth cookies).

2. Exchange these auth cookies for an NPSSO token.

3. Exchange your NPSSO token for an access code.

4. Exchange your access code for an access token and a refresh token.

Once you have an access token, you can retrieve data from the PSN API.

Access tokens are short-lived and yours will expire after only a few hours. When this happens, it's best practice to get a new access token [by using your refresh token](/authentication/using-your-refresh-token).

## Get started

### Log in

In your web browser, visit [the PlayStation homepage](https://www.playstation.com/), click the "Sign In" button, and log in with a PSN account.

### Retrieve your NPSSO token

In the same browser that you used to log in (due to a persisted cookie), visit [this page](https://ca.account.sony.com/api/v1/ssocookie). You will see a JSON response that looks something like:

```json
{ "npsso": "<64 character token>" }
```

If you see an error response, try using a different browser.

### Exchange your NPSSO token

You can now obtain an access token and a refresh token using your NPSSO with the following function calls from this package.

```ts
// This is the value you copied from the previous step.
const myNpsso = "<64 character token>";

// We'll exchange your NPSSO for a special access code.
const accessCode = await exchangeNpssoForAccessCode(npsso);

// ðŸš€ We can use the access code to get your access token and refresh token.
const authorization = await exchangeCodeForAccessToken(accessCode);
```
