/**
 * A title may have multiple groups of trophies. This is most commonly
 * seen in games which have DLC expansions where additional trophies are added.
 *
 * You can call this function for a specific title - using the
 * unique `npCommunicationId` for the title - and you will receive a
 * summary of all of the trophy groups associated with the title.
 * This also includes a summary of the number of trophies for the
 * title, broken down by group and grade (gold, silver, etc.).
 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your access token, typically retrieved with `exchangeCodeForAccessToken()`.
 * @param npCommunicationId The unique ID of the game title you wish to retrieve the trophy groups list for.
 * @param options.npServiceName `"trophy"` for PS3, PS4, or PS Vita platforms. `"trophy2"` for the PS5 platform.
 * @param options.headerOverrides Override the headers in the request to the PSN API, such as to change the language.
