/**
 * A call to this function will retrieve the earned status of trophies for a user
 * from either a single - or all - trophy groups in a title. A title can have
 * multiple groups of trophies (a `"default"` group which all titles have, and
 * additional groups starting with a name of `"001"` and incrementing for each
 * additional group). To retrieve trophies from all groups within a title
 * (ie. the full trophy set), `trophyGroupId` should be set to `"all"`.
 *
 * The numeric `accountId` can be that of any PSN account for which the authenticating
 * account has permissions to view the trophy list. When querying the titles
 * associated with the authenticating account, the numeric `accountId` can be
 * substituted with `"me"`.
 *
 * Included in the information returned is the titles' unique `npCommunicationId`.
 * This is required to make use of subsequent functions for requesting more specific
 * detail about a title's trophies.
 *
 * The results are presented in order of the `lastUpdatedDateTime` for the title,
 * so the first result will be the title for which a trophy was most recently earned
 * (or synced for the first time in the case of a game with 0% progress).
 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your access token, typically retrieved with `exchangeCodeForAccessToken()`.
 * @param accountId The account whose trophy list is being accessed. Use `"me"` for the authenticating account.
 * @param options.limit Limit the number of titles returned.
 * @param options.offset Return title data from this result onwards.
 * @param options.headerOverrides Override the headers in the request to the PSN API, such as to change the language.
