 * A request to this endpoint function will retrieve a summary of the trophies earned for
 * a user broken down by trophy group within a title. A title can have
 * multiple groups of trophies (a `"default"` group which all titles have,
 * and additional groups beginning with the name `"001"` and incrementing for
 * each additional group).
 *
 * The numeric `accountId` can be that of any PSN account for which the
 * authenticating account has permissions to view the trophy list.
 * When querying the titles associated with the authenticating account, the
 * numeric `accountId` can be substituted with `"me"`.
 *
 * This function calls an endpoint that returns the earned status of the
 * trophy only and no additional descriptive metadata (ie. trophy name,
 * trophy description). Use `getTitleTrophies()` to obtain this information.
 *
 *  When the title platform is PS3, PS4 or PS Vita you __must__ specify the
 * `npServiceName` option as `"trophy"`.
 *
 * If you attempt to query a title which the user does not have associated
 * with their account (ie. the title has not been launched and allowed to
 * sync at least once) then a Resource Not Found error will be thrown.
 *
 * @param authorization An object containing your access token, typically retrieved with `exchangeCodeForAccessToken()`.
 * @param accountId The account whose trophy list is being accessed. Use `"me"` for the authenticating account.
 * @param npCommunicationId Unique ID of the title.
 * @param options.npServiceName `"trophy"` for PS3, PS4, or PS Vita platforms. `"trophy2"` for the PS5 platform.
 * @param options.headerOverrides Override the headers in the request to the PSN API, such as to change the language.
